# Resume Description

I’m a Software Developer with almost 9 years of experience in the analysis, development, and continuous improvement of technological solutions across diverse sectors, including insurance, finance, healthcare, energy, and telecommunications.

Throughout my career, I’ve collaborated with distributed teams in Peru, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil, which has helped me develop strong skills in multicultural environments and adapting to dynamic work processes.

I’ve contributed to agile teams using Scrum to deliver scalable solutions, and I’ve also led a team of young developers, guiding them through their professional growth. My experience includes developing microservices with Spring Boot and managing various versions of Java. Additionally, I possess solid expertise in DevOps, Scrum, and Cloud (AWS and Azure).

My technical background includes working with Python, Node.js, and managing both relational (MSSQL, OracleSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and non-relational databases (MongoDB, Elasticsearch), as well as in-memory solutions like Redis.

I am particularly passionate about microservices development, focusing on fast, scalable solutions, efficient documentation, and seamless integration with Java. I am always curious and committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technological advancements to improve my skills and contribute to the success of my teams.
