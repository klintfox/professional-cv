# Resume

Iâ€™m a Software Developer with almost 9 years of experience working in the analysis, development, maintenance, and continuous improvement of technological solutions, across sectors includes insurance, finance, healthcare, energy, and telecommunications.

I have had the opportunity to collaborate, both in-person and remotely, with teams distributed across Peru, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil, which has allowed me to develop strong skills in working in multicultural environments and adapting to diverse work dynamics and processes.

I have been part of agile teams using Scrum to implement robust and scalable solutions, always focused on delivering continuous and efficient value. Additionally, I have led young developers for a year, guiding them in their professional growth. My experience includes microservices development with Spring Boot and managing multiple versions of Java. I also have solid knowledge of DevOps, Scrum, and Cloud  like AWS and Azure. 
Also, I have some professional experience working with Python and Node.js, as well as managing relational databases like Microsoft SQL, Oracle SQL, MySQL and PostgreSQL and non-relational databases like MongoDB and Elasticsearch
 
Finally, I highlight my focus on microservices development, their proper documentation, and the efficient integration of libraries and technological products with Java, which allows me to deliver fast and scalable solutions, optimizing processes and improving software quality. I maintain a constant curiosity and passion for learning, always striving to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technological trends.
